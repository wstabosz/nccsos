  <h2 id="does-it-really-cost-less-than-netflix-">Does it really cost less than Netflix ?</h2>

  <p>Yes, it does. Most people will pay around $5.41 per month for <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>. Some people will pay more, others will pay less. The exact cost that you can expect to pay depends on where you live in New Castle County.</p>

  <h2 id="this-sounds-great-how-do-i-subscribe-">This sounds great! How do I subscribe ?</h2>

  <p>This is where things get a bit tricky. In order to get the great services of <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>, all of us (the citizens of New Castle County) have to subscribe. This means we all have to engage in the political process a tiny bit. We all need to do a few things:</p>

  <h3 id="contact-your-new-castle-county-councilperson">1. Contact your New Castle County Councilperson</h3>
  <p>Tell them you want them to subscribe to <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>.</p>

  <p><a href="/contact-your-ncc-council-member">Click here for instructions on how to contact your County Council member</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="contact-your-state-representatives">2. Contact your State Representatives</h3>
  <p>Tell our State Representatives that we want their help raising revenue to us cover some of the costs of <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>.</p>

  <p><a href="/contact-your-state-legislature">Click here for instructions on how to contact your state legislator</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="tell-your-friends-about-ncc-deluxe">Tell your friends about <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>.</h3>
  <p>The more people who do steps 1 &amp; 2, the more likely it is that we will get our subscription.</p>

  <h2 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-want-to-subscribe-">What happens if I don’t want to subscribe ?</h2>

  <p>While it saddens me that not everyone can appreciate the value offered by <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>, there are some things you should know before you decide not to subscribe. Without <strong><em>NCC Deluxe</em></strong>, we will all miss out on all the great features mentioned above.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Should you need to call 911, you can expect longer wait times</li>
    <li>There will be less paramedics to response to your emergency</li>
    <li>There will be less neighborhood police officers to keep you and your family safe</li>
    <li>Two libraries will have to be closed.
      <ul>
        <li>1 small (Elsmere)</li>
        <li>1 large (Route 9 Library, Brandywine Library)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Two regional county parks will have to close (Carousel Park, Glasgow Park, etc)</li>
    <li>Grass will no longer be mowed at all 200+ neighborhood parks.</li>
    <li>Either the Rockwood Museum will close, or the county sports leagues will be reduced</li>
    <li>But on the plus side, you’ll be able to buy two extra iced coffees every month</li>
  </ul>
