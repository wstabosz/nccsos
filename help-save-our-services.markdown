I can't do this alone. I need your help.

## Spread the word
Best thing to do is spread the word. Here are some ways to share:

If you're on facebook, you can share my [public post](https://www.facebook.com/walter.stabosz/posts/10104608762579754).

Or you can post on your favorite social media site using this [picture](/uploads/would%20you%20rather%20-%20facebook%202.png) and a link to [http://www.nccsos.com/](http://www.nccsos.com/)

Here is some copy you can use in your post.

The New Castle County Council votes on the 2019 budget this Tuesday @ 6:30PM. If the budget vote fails to pass, a number of county services will face cuts. Including: 2 libraries, 1 large regional part (Carousal/Glasgow), grass mowing at all 200+ neighborhood parks, the sports leagues (or Rockwood Museum). Also we face reduced EMT and 911 services.

Visit http://www.nccsos.com/ to find out how to contact the Council and tell them you want them to vote to keep our great services.

Share this post with all you NCC friends. We need them to call/email too.
