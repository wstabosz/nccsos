Imagine if you could have better libraries, parks, and public safety right here in our very own New Castle County, and all for less than the cost of your monthly _Netflix_ subscription?

I'm asking you to join me in subscribing to a package of services I like to call **_NCC Deluxe_** .


### What is **_NCC Deluxe_** ?

Think of **_NCC Deluxe_** as a service that improves the quality-of-life for all residents of New Castle County. It has features that are so amazing, you will not believe the value you get for your money when you subscribe. Feature such as â€¦.

_Public Safety_ features:


*   Faster 911 and paramedic response times
*   Police officers who engage with communities to keep neighborhoods safe.
*   If you have a cardiac arrest in NCC, and someone calls 911, you've got a 30% better chance of surviving than in many other parts of the country.

_Educational_ features:



*   The [Route 9 Library and Innovation Center](http://www.nccde.org/1389/Route-9-Library-Innovation-Center) - Come for the Lego play room, stay for the 3D printer and laser cutter.
*   Other greats major libraries such as the [Brandywine Hundred Library](http://www.nccde.org/294/Brandywine-Hundred-Library)

### This sounds great! How do I subscribe ?

### What happens if I don't want to subscribe ?

While it saddens me that not everyone can appreciate the value offered by **_NCC Deluxe_**, there are some things you should know before you decide not to subscribe. Without **_NCC Deluxe_**, we will all miss out on all the great features mentioned above.


*   Should you need to call 911, you can expect longer wait times
*   There will be less paramedics to response to your emergency
*   There will be less neighborhood police officers to keep you and your family safe
*   Two libraries will have to be closed. 
    *   1 small (Elsmere)
    *   1 large (Route 9 Library, Brandywine Library)
*   Two regional county parks will have to close (Carousel Park, Glasgow Park, etc)
*   Grass will no longer be mowed at all 200+ neighborhood parks.
*   Either the Rockwood Museum will close, or the county sports leagues will be reduced
*   But on the plus side, you'll be able to buy two extra iced coffees every month
